I was assigned a project. It was based on Plinkos.
So, Plinkos were obstacles that were placed on the screen.
The Particles which were spawned continuously bounced off these Plinkos and eventually came down.
There were bucket objects that were placed below which contained the particles that fell down.
Plinko shows the probability of an object to fall either on the right or left.
As it has a 50% chance of falling to the left, and 50% chance of falling to the right.

When you click your mouse, your particle drops down at the point of the click and you score points according to the bucket it fells down.
